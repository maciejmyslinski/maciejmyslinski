# Maciej Myśliński

## Is pleased to meet you here

 My name is Maciej Myśliński. I am 22 years old and live in Poznań, Poland. I am happy husband, brother and friend to my fellow ones. I look at the future with passion and curiosity. In my professional career I use my skills to help companies increase their income.

## Robson Company Website

When I was starting this project I knew very little about php and nearly nothing about MVC frameworks, such as Symfony. Though I was familiar with CSS and HTML, I never worked with SASS and HTML5. This project made me very comfortable with these technologies. I listed them and few more skills below.

* PHP
* Symfony
* AWS Services
* HTML
* CSS
* SASS
* RWD (Responsive Web Design)
* Email Templates
* Google Maps

### How your work increased the company’s revenue?

This website helped Robson’s company mostly by crafted web forms. Since the beginning of 2015 customers submitted hundreds of requests with provided great income for the company.
